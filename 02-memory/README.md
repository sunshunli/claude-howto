# Memory Guide

Memory enables Claude to retain context across sessions and conversations. It exists in two forms: automatic synthesis in claude.ai, and filesystem-based CLAUDE.md in Claude Code.

## Overview

Memory in Claude Code provides persistent context that carries across multiple sessions and conversations. Unlike temporary context windows, memory files allow you to:

- Share project standards across your team
- Store personal development preferences
- Maintain directory-specific rules and configurations
- Import external documentation
- Version control memory as part of your project

The memory system operates at multiple levels, from global personal preferences down to specific subdirectories, allowing for fine-grained control over what Claude remembers and how it applies that knowledge.

## Memory Commands Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | Usage | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/init` | Initialize project memory | `/init` | Starting new project, first-time CLAUDE.md setup |
| `/memory` | Edit memory files in editor | `/memory` | Extensive updates, reorganization, reviewing content |
| `#` prefix | ~~Quick single-line memory add~~ **Discontinued** | — | Use `/memory` or ask conversationally instead |
| `@path/to/file` | Import external content | `@README.md` or `@docs/api.md` | Referencing existing documentation in CLAUDE.md |

## Quick Start: Initializing Memory

### The `/init` Command

The `/init` command is the fastest way to set up project memory in Claude Code. It initializes a CLAUDE.md file with foundational project documentation.

**Usage:**

```bash
/init
```

**What it does:**

- Creates a new CLAUDE.md file in your project (typically at `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- Establishes project conventions and guidelines
- Sets up the foundation for context persistence across sessions
- Provides a template structure for documenting your project standards

**Enhanced interactive mode:** Set `CLAUDE_CODE_NEW_INIT=1` to enable a multi-phase interactive flow that walks you through project setup step by step:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_NEW_INIT=1 claude
/init
```

**When to use `/init`:**

- Starting a new project with Claude Code
- Establishing team coding standards and conventions
- Creating documentation about your codebase structure
- Setting up memory hierarchy for collaborative development

**Example workflow:**

```markdown
# In your project directory
/init

# Claude creates CLAUDE.md with structure like:
# Project Configuration
## Project Overview
- Name: Your Project
- Tech Stack: [Your technologies]
- Team Size: [Number of developers]

## Development Standards
- Code style preferences
- Testing requirements
- Git workflow conventions
```

### Quick Memory Updates

> **Note**: The `#` shortcut for inline memory was discontinued. Use `/memory` to edit memory files directly, or ask Claude conversationally to remember something (e.g., "remember that we always use TypeScript strict mode").

The recommended ways to add information to memory are:

**Option 1: Use `/memory` command**

```bash
/memory
```

Opens your memory files in your system editor for direct editing.

**Option 2: Ask conversationally**

```
Remember that we always use TypeScript strict mode in this project.
Please add to memory: prefer async/await over promise chains.
```

Claude will update the appropriate CLAUDE.md file based on your request.

**Historical reference** (no longer functional):

The `#` prefix shortcut previously allowed adding rules inline:

```markdown
# Always use TypeScript strict mode in this project  ← no longer works
```

If you relied on this pattern, switch to the `/memory` command or conversational requests.

### The `/memory` Command

The `/memory` command provides direct access to edit your CLAUDE.md memory files within Claude Code sessions. It opens your memory files in your system editor for comprehensive editing. When the file opens in a GUI editor, the session no longer blocks while the file stays open, so you can keep working in parallel (v2.1.216); terminal editors like Vim still take over the terminal until you exit.

**Usage:**

```bash
/memory
```

**What it does:**

- Opens your memory files in your system's default editor
- Allows you to make extensive additions, modifications, and reorganizations
- Provides direct access to all memory files in the hierarchy
- Enables you to manage persistent context across sessions

**When to use `/memory`:**

- Reviewing existing memory content
- Making extensive updates to project standards
- Reorganizing memory structure
- Adding detailed documentation or guidelines
- Maintaining and updating memory as your project evolves

**Comparison: `/memory` vs `/init`**

| Aspect | `/memory` | `/init` |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Edit existing memory files | Initialize new CLAUDE.md |
| **When to use** | Update/modify project context | Begin new projects |
| **Action** | Opens editor for changes | Generates starter template |
| **Workflow** | Ongoing maintenance | One-time setup |

**Example workflow:**

```markdown
# Open memory for editing
/memory

# Claude presents options:
# 1. Managed Policy Memory
# 2. Project Memory (./CLAUDE.md)
# 3. User Memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
# 4. Local Project Memory

# Choose option 2 (Project Memory)
# Your default editor opens with ./CLAUDE.md content

# Make changes, save, and close editor
# Claude automatically reloads the updated memory
```

**Using Memory Imports:**

CLAUDE.md files support the `@path/to/file` syntax to include external content:

```markdown
# Project Documentation
See @README.md for project overview
See @package.json for available npm commands
See @docs/architecture.md for system design

# Import from home directory using absolute path
@~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

**Import features:**

- Both relative and absolute paths are supported (e.g., `@docs/api.md` or `@~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md`)
- Recursive imports are supported with a maximum depth of 4 hops
- First-time imports from external locations trigger an approval dialog for security
- Import directives are not evaluated inside markdown code spans or code blocks (so documenting them in examples is safe)
- Helps avoid duplication by referencing existing documentation
- Automatically includes referenced content in Claude's context

## Memory Architecture

Memory in Claude Code follows a hierarchical system where different scopes serve different purposes. Unlike Claude Web/Desktop's 24-hour synthesis cycle (see [Memory in Claude Web/Desktop](#memory-in-claude-webdesktop) below), Claude Code has two memory systems that both load at the start of every session and update continuously, not on a timer:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A["Session Start"]
    B["CLAUDE.md Files<br/>(you write)"]
    C["Auto Memory<br/>(Claude writes)"]
    D["Claude Session"]
    E["Your Correction /<br/>Preference"]

    B -->|loaded in full| A
    C -->|MEMORY.md loaded| A
    A --> D
    D -->|"Remember that..."| E
    E -->|writes during session| C
    D -->|"add this to CLAUDE.md"| B
```

## Memory Hierarchy in Claude Code

Claude Code has two complementary memory systems, both loaded at the start of every conversation: **CLAUDE.md files** (instructions you write) and **auto memory** (notes Claude writes itself). CLAUDE.md files are **concatenated into context rather than overriding each other** — this is not a strict precedence chain where a higher tier replaces a lower one. `.claude/rules/*.md` files are a separate, related mechanism for topic- or path-scoped instructions.

**CLAUDE.md file locations, in load order (broadest scope to most specific):**

| Scope | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Managed policy | macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`<br>Linux/WSL: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`<br>Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps. Cannot be excluded by individual settings. |
| User instructions | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects |
| Project instructions | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Team-shared instructions, version controlled |
| Local instructions | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project-specific preferences; add to `.gitignore` |

Within the directory tree, Claude Code walks up from your working directory: `foo/CLAUDE.md` loads before `foo/bar/CLAUDE.md` if you launch from `foo/bar/`, so instructions closer to where you launched are read *last* — not "highest priority" in an override sense, just most recent in context. Within each directory, `CLAUDE.local.md` is appended after `CLAUDE.md`. CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md files in subdirectories *under* your working directory load on demand, when Claude reads files in those subdirectories, rather than at launch.

Organizations can also put managed CLAUDE.md content directly inside `managed-settings.json` via the `claudeMd` key, instead of deploying a separate file. This is honored only in managed/policy settings — setting `claudeMd` in user or project settings has no effect.

**`.claude/rules/*.md`** — modular, topic-specific instructions, optionally scoped to file paths via `paths` frontmatter. Rules without a `paths` field load unconditionally with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; path-scoped rules load on demand when Claude reads a matching file. User-level rules (`~/.claude/rules/`) load before project rules.

**Auto memory** (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`) is a separate system: Claude's own notes, not CLAUDE.md content, and not part of the concatenation order above. See [Auto Memory](#auto-memory) below.

> **Note**: `CLAUDE.local.md` is fully supported and documented in the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory). It provides personal project-specific preferences that are not committed to version control. Add `CLAUDE.local.md` to your `.gitignore`.

**Memory Discovery Behavior:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Managed Policy<br/>/Library/.../ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md"] -->|loads first| B["User Instructions<br/>~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"]
    B --> C["Project Instructions<br/>./CLAUDE.md or ./.claude/CLAUDE.md"]
    C --> D["Local Instructions<br/>./CLAUDE.local.md"]

    C -->|imports| H["@docs/architecture.md"]
    H -->|imports| I["@docs/api-standards.md"]

    style A fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style B fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style C fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style D fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style H fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style I fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
```

All files shown are concatenated into one context, not selected by override — later boxes appear later in context, not "instead of" earlier ones.

## Excluding CLAUDE.md Files with `claudeMdExcludes`

In large monorepos, some CLAUDE.md files may be irrelevant to your current work. The `claudeMdExcludes` setting lets you skip specific CLAUDE.md files so they are not loaded into context:

```jsonc
// In ~/.claude/settings.json or .claude/settings.json
{
  "claudeMdExcludes": [
    "packages/legacy-app/CLAUDE.md",
    "vendors/**/CLAUDE.md"
  ]
}
```

Patterns are matched against paths relative to the project root. This is particularly useful for:

- Monorepos with many sub-projects, where only some are relevant
- Repositories that contain vendored or third-party CLAUDE.md files
- Reducing noise in Claude's context window by excluding stale or unrelated instructions

## Settings File Hierarchy

Claude Code settings (including `autoMemoryDirectory`, `claudeMdExcludes`, and other configuration) resolve by precedence — unlike CLAUDE.md files above, settings genuinely override rather than concatenate. When the same setting appears in multiple scopes, the higher level wins:

| Level | Location | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 (Highest) | Managed — `managed-settings.json`, plist/registry, or server-managed | Organization-wide enforcement; cannot be overridden |
| 2 | Command line arguments | Temporary session overrides |
| 3 | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local overrides (git-ignored) |
| 4 | `.claude/settings.json` | Project-level (committed to git) |
| 5 (Lowest) | `~/.claude/settings.json` | User preferences |

Managed settings also support a drop-in directory, `managed-settings.d/`, alongside `managed-settings.json`: the base file merges first, then `*.json` files in the drop-in directory merge on top in alphabetical order (scalars override, arrays concatenate and de-duplicate, objects deep-merge). This lets separate teams deploy independent policy fragments without editing a shared file. Note this is a **settings.json** mechanism, not a CLAUDE.md one — it doesn't apply to the CLAUDE.md file locations described above.

Permission rules (`allow`/`ask`/`deny`) behave differently from other settings: they merge across scopes instead of the higher level replacing the lower one.

**Platform-specific configuration (v2.1.51+):**

Settings can also be configured via:
- **macOS**: Property list (plist) files
- **Windows**: Windows Registry

These platform-native mechanisms are read alongside JSON settings files and follow the same precedence rules.

> **Note (v2.1.119)**: `/config` changes now persist to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Values written via `/config` participate in the normal policy/local/project precedence chain described above — they are no longer session-only. Use `/config` for interactive edits and edit `settings.json` files directly for scripted or managed configuration.

### Retention and Cleanup Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cleanupPeriodDays` | integer (days) | 30 | Retention window for on-disk artifacts. **As of v2.1.117**, it applies to all four of: checkpoints (`~/.claude/checkpoints/`), tasks (`~/.claude/tasks/`), shell-snapshots (`~/.claude/shell-snapshots/`), and backups (`~/.claude/backups/`). Files older than the window are pruned at startup. |

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "cleanupPeriodDays": 14
}
```

### Attribution, Voice, and PR URL Settings

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `attribution.commit` | boolean | Adds the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer to commits Claude creates. Replaces the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` flag. |
| `attribution.pr` | boolean | Adds Claude attribution to pull request descriptions. Replaces the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` flag for PRs. |
| `attribution.sessionUrl` | boolean | Omit the claude.ai session link from commits and PRs created in web and Remote Control sessions (v2.1.183+). |
| `voice.enabled` | boolean | Enables push-to-talk voice dictation (`/voice`). Replaces the deprecated `voiceEnabled` flag. |
| `prUrlTemplate` | string | **New in v2.1.119.** Custom URL template for the footer PR badge; useful for GitLab, Bitbucket, or internal code-review platforms. Supports `{{owner}}`, `{{repo}}`, and `{{number}}` placeholders. |

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": false,
    "pr": true
  },
  "voice": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "prUrlTemplate": "https://gitlab.internal/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/-/merge_requests/{{number}}"
}
```

#### Deprecated setting names

The following legacy setting keys still work but are deprecated. Prefer the replacements above.

| Deprecated key | Replacement | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| `includeCoAuthoredBy` | `attribution.commit` / `attribution.pr` | The old single flag is split into separate commit and PR switches. Users on older installs can keep the legacy key; new projects should use the nested form. |
| `voiceEnabled` | `voice.enabled` | Grouped under the `voice` namespace alongside future voice-related options. |

## Modular Rules System

Create organized, path-specific rules using the `.claude/rules/` directory structure. Rules can be defined at both the project level and user level:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   └── rules/
│       ├── code-style.md
│       ├── testing.md
│       ├── security.md
│       └── api/                  # Subdirectories supported
│           ├── conventions.md
│           └── validation.md

~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md
└── rules/                        # User-level rules (all projects)
    ├── personal-style.md
    └── preferred-patterns.md
```

Rules are discovered recursively within the `rules/` directory, including any subdirectories. User-level rules at `~/.claude/rules/` are loaded before project-level rules, allowing personal defaults that projects can override.

### Path-Specific Rules with YAML Frontmatter

Define rules that apply only to specific file paths:

```markdown
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use Zod for schema validation
- Document all parameters and response types
- Include error handling for all operations
```

**Glob Pattern Examples:**

- `**/*.ts` - All TypeScript files
- `src/**/*` - All files under src/
- `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` - Multiple extensions
- `{src,lib}/**/*.ts, tests/**/*.test.ts` - Multiple patterns

### Subdirectories and Symlinks

Rules in `.claude/rules/` support two organizational features:

- **Subdirectories**: Rules are discovered recursively, so you can organize them into topic-based folders (e.g., `rules/api/`, `rules/testing/`, `rules/security/`)
- **Symlinks**: Symlinks are supported for sharing rules across multiple projects. For example, you can symlink a shared rule file from a central location into each project's `.claude/rules/` directory

## Memory Locations Table

CLAUDE.md files and rules are concatenated into context, not selected by strict override — "Load order" below means *where in context it appears*, not *which one wins*. Auto memory is a separate mechanism with its own storage location.

| Location | Type | Load order | Shared | Access | Best For |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) | Managed Policy | 1st (loads first) | Organization | System | Company-wide policies |
| `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` (Linux/WSL) | Managed Policy | 1st (loads first) | Organization | System | Organization standards |
| `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md` (Windows) | Managed Policy | 1st (loads first) | Organization | System | Corporate guidelines |
| `~/.claude/rules/*.md` | User Rules | 2nd | Individual | Filesystem | Personal rules (all projects) |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User Memory | 3rd | Individual | Filesystem | Personal preferences (all projects) |
| `./.claude/rules/*.md` | Project Rules | 4th | Team | Git | Path-specific, modular rules |
| `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Project Memory | 5th | Team | Git | Team standards, shared architecture |
| `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Project Local | 6th (loads last) | Individual | Git (ignored) | Personal project-specific preferences |
| `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` | Auto Memory | N/A — separate mechanism | Individual | Filesystem | Claude's automatic notes and learnings |

## Memory Update Lifecycle

Here's how memory updates flow through your Claude Code sessions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Claude as Claude Code
    participant Editor as File System
    participant Memory as CLAUDE.md

    User->>Claude: "Remember: use async/await"
    Claude->>User: "Which memory file?"
    User->>Claude: "Project memory"
    Claude->>Editor: Open ~/.claude/settings.json
    Claude->>Memory: Write to ./CLAUDE.md
    Memory-->>Claude: File saved
    Claude->>Claude: Load updated memory
    Claude-->>User: "Memory saved!"
```

## Auto Memory

Auto memory is a persistent directory where Claude automatically records learnings, patterns, and insights as it works with your project. Unlike CLAUDE.md files which you write and maintain manually, auto memory is written by Claude itself during sessions.

### How Auto Memory Works

- **Location**: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`
- **Entrypoint**: `MEMORY.md` serves as the main file in the auto memory directory
- **Topic files**: Optional additional files for specific subjects (e.g., `debugging.md`, `api-conventions.md`)
- **Loading behavior**: The first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` (or first 25KB, whichever comes first) are loaded into context at session start. Topic files are loaded on demand, not at startup.
- **Read/write**: Claude reads and writes memory files during sessions as it discovers patterns and project-specific knowledge
- **Frontmatter**: Files that begin with YAML frontmatter get a `modified` field — an ISO 8601 timestamp Claude Code records each time it writes the file (v2.1.214)

    style I fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#333,color:#333
```

### Auto Memory Directory Structure

```
~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/
├── MEMORY.md              # Entrypoint (first 200 lines / 25KB loaded at startup)
├── debugging.md           # Topic file (loaded on demand)
├── api-conventions.md     # Topic file (loaded on demand)
└── testing-patterns.md    # Topic file (loaded on demand)
```

### Version Requirement

Auto memory requires **Claude Code v2.1.59 or later**. If you are on an older version, upgrade first:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

### Turning Auto Memory On or Off

Auto memory is **on by default**. The `autoMemoryEnabled` setting (default `true`) controls it; when `false`, Claude neither reads from nor writes to the auto memory directory. You can also toggle it with `/memory` during a session.

```json
{
  "autoMemoryEnabled": false
}
```

To disable it via environment instead, set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1`. Setting it to `0` forces auto memory **on** even when `--bare` mode or `autoMemoryEnabled: false` would otherwise disable it.

### Custom Auto Memory Directory

By default, auto memory is stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. You can change this location using the `autoMemoryDirectory` setting (available since **v2.1.74**):

```jsonc
// In ~/.claude/settings.json or .claude/settings.local.json (user/local settings only)
{
  "autoMemoryDirectory": "/path/to/custom/memory/directory"
}
```

> **Note**: `autoMemoryDirectory` can only be set in user-level (`~/.claude/settings.json`) or local settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`), not in project or managed policy settings.

This is useful when you want to:

- Store auto memory in a shared or synced location
- Separate auto memory from the default Claude configuration directory
- Use a project-specific path outside the default hierarchy

### Worktree and Repository Sharing

All worktrees and subdirectories within the same git repository share a single auto memory directory. This means switching between worktrees or working in different subdirectories of the same repo will read and write to the same memory files.

### Subagent Memory

Subagents (spawned via tools like Task or parallel execution) can have their own memory context. Use the `memory` frontmatter field in the subagent definition to specify which memory scopes to load:

```yaml
memory: user      # Load user-level memory only
memory: project   # Load project-level memory only
memory: local     # Load local memory only
```

This allows subagents to operate with focused context rather than inheriting the full memory hierarchy.

> **Note**: Subagents can also maintain their own auto memory. See the [official subagent memory documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#enable-persistent-memory) for details.

### Controlling Auto Memory

Auto memory can be controlled via the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY` environment variable:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | Force auto memory **on** |
| `1` | Force auto memory **off** |
| *(unset)* | Default behavior (auto memory enabled) |

```bash
# Disable auto memory for a session
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1 claude

# Force auto memory on explicitly
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0 claude
```

## Additional Directories with `--add-dir`

The `--add-dir` flag allows Claude Code to load CLAUDE.md files from additional directories beyond the current working directory. This is useful for monorepos or multi-project setups where context from other directories is relevant.

To enable this feature, set the environment variable:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1
```

Then launch Claude Code with the flag:

```bash
claude --add-dir /path/to/other/project
```

Claude will load CLAUDE.md from the specified additional directory alongside the memory files from your current working directory.

### Example 2: Directory-Specific Memory

**File:** `./src/api/CLAUDE.md`

````markdown
# API Module Standards

This file supplements root CLAUDE.md for everything in /src/api/. Memory files are
concatenated, not overridden — the root CLAUDE.md still applies, and Claude Code
loads this file on demand when it reads files in this subtree.

## API-Specific Standards

# My Development Preferences

## About Me
- **Experience Level**: 8 years full-stack development
- **Preferred Languages**: TypeScript, Python
- **Communication Style**: Direct, with examples
- **Learning Style**: Visual diagrams with code

## Code Preferences

### Error Handling
I prefer explicit error handling with try-catch blocks and meaningful error messages.
Avoid generic errors. Always log errors for debugging.

### Comments
Use comments for WHY, not WHAT. Code should be self-documenting.
Comments should explain business logic or non-obvious decisions.

### Testing
I prefer TDD (test-driven development).
Write tests first, then implementation.
Focus on behavior, not implementation details.

### Architecture
I prefer modular, loosely-coupled design.
Use dependency injection for testability.
Separate concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories).

## Debugging Preferences
- Use console.log with prefix: `[DEBUG]`
- Include context: function name, relevant variables
- Use stack traces when available
- Always include timestamps in logs

## Communication
- Explain complex concepts with diagrams
- Show concrete examples before explaining theory
- Include before/after code snippets
- Summarize key points at the end

## Project Organization
I organize my projects as:

   project/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── api/
   │   ├── services/
   │   ├── models/
   │   └── utils/
   ├── tests/
   ├── docs/
   └── docker/

## Tooling
- **IDE**: VS Code with vim keybindings
- **Terminal**: Zsh with Oh-My-Zsh
- **Format**: Prettier (100 char line length)
- **Linter**: ESLint with airbnb config
- **Test Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
```

_My Test_
Ask Claude to save a new rule

![Ask Claude to save a new rule](memory-ask-claude.png)
Claude has not save the rule because I did not have any `Claude.md` file anywhere. Then asked Claude to confirm the location.

![Ask Claude to save a new rule](memory-saved.png)

### Example 4: Memory Update During Session

You can add new rules to memory during an active Claude Code session by asking conversationally:

```markdown
User: Remember that I prefer using React hooks instead of class components
     for all new components.

Claude: I'm adding that to your memory. Which memory file should this go in?
        1. Project memory (./CLAUDE.md)
        2. Personal memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)

User: Project memory

Claude: ✅ Memory saved!

Added to ./CLAUDE.md:
---

### Component Development
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Prefer hooks over class components
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use useCallback for event handlers
- Use useMemo for expensive computations
```

Or use `/memory` to edit memory files directly for extensive updates or reorganization.

#### Tips for Adding Memory

- Be specific and actionable in your rules
- Group related rules together under a section header
- Update existing sections instead of duplicating content
- Choose the appropriate memory scope (project vs. personal)

## Best Practices

### Do's - What To Include

- **Be specific and detailed**: Use clear, detailed instructions rather than vague guidance
  - ✅ Good: "Use 2-space indentation for all JavaScript files"
  - ❌ Avoid: "Follow best practices"

- **Keep organized**: Structure memory files with clear markdown sections and headings

- **Use appropriate hierarchy levels**:
  - **Managed policy**: Company-wide policies, security standards, compliance requirements
  - **Project memory**: Team standards, architecture, coding conventions (commit to git)
  - **User memory**: Personal preferences, communication style, tooling choices
  - **Directory memory**: Module-specific rules and overrides

- **Leverage imports**: Use `@path/to/file` syntax to reference existing documentation
  - Supports a maximum depth of 4 hops for recursive imports
  - Avoids duplication across memory files
  - Example: `See @README.md for project overview`

- **Document frequent commands**: Include commands you use repeatedly to save time

- **Version control project memory**: Commit project-level CLAUDE.md files to git for team benefit

- **Review periodically**: Update memory regularly as projects evolve and requirements change

- **Provide concrete examples**: Include code snippets and specific scenarios

### Don'ts - What To Avoid

- **Don't store secrets**: Never include API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials

- **Don't include sensitive data**: No PII, private information, or proprietary secrets

- **Don't duplicate content**: Use imports (`@path`) to reference existing documentation instead

- **Don't be vague**: Avoid generic statements like "follow best practices" or "write good code"

- **Don't make it too long**: Target **under 200 lines** per CLAUDE.md. Longer files still load in full, but adherence drops — see [Keeping CLAUDE.md small](#keeping-claudemd-small) below

- **Don't over-organize**: Use hierarchy strategically; don't create excessive subdirectory overrides

- **Don't forget to update**: Stale memory can cause confusion and outdated practices

- **Don't exceed nesting limits**: Memory imports support a maximum depth of 4 hops

### Keeping CLAUDE.md Small

Anthropic's current guidance is the opposite of "put everything in CLAUDE.md". The file loads into **every** session, so every line you add is a line that competes for attention on tasks it has nothing to do with.

**Rule of thumb: keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines.** Longer files still load in full, but instruction adherence degrades as the file grows.

When it starts growing, move content out rather than trimming prose:

| Content | Where it belongs | Why |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| Multi-step procedures | A [skill](../03-skills/) | Loads on demand, only when relevant |
| Directory- or file-type-specific rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` with `paths:` frontmatter | Scoped by glob; loads only when you touch matching files |
| Reference material and long examples | A skill's `references/` directory | Read only when the skill needs it |
| Things Claude should remember about *you* | Auto memory (on by default) | Written and loaded automatically |

> **Note**: `@path` imports organize a large CLAUDE.md but do **not** save context — imported files are pulled in at load time just the same. Splitting into path-scoped rules is what actually reduces what loads.

`/doctor` (v2.1.206+) inspects your configuration and proposes trims when CLAUDE.md has grown past the point of usefulness.

### Don't Write Verification Reminders

Older guidance encouraged lines like "always run the tests before saying you're done" or "double-check your work". On **Claude Opus 5 and Fable 5 these now cause over-verification** — Claude re-checks work that was already correct, burning turns and tokens.

Anthropic removed more than 80% of Claude Code's own system prompt for the Claude 5 generation with no measured regression. The same principle applies to your CLAUDE.md: prefer stating the goal and letting Claude exercise judgment over enumerating the checks it should perform.

Delete verification reminders from existing CLAUDE.md files targeting Opus 5 or Fable 5. Keep genuinely non-obvious project requirements — "integration tests need Docker running" is information, not a reminder.

### Memory Management Tips

**Choose the right memory level:**

| Use Case | Memory Level | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Company security policy | Managed Policy | Applies to all projects organization-wide |
| Team code style guide | Project | Shared with team via git |
| Your preferred editor shortcuts | User | Personal preference, not shared |
| API module standards | Directory | Specific to that module only |

**Quick update workflow:**

1. For single rules: Use `/memory` to open editor, or ask conversationally
2. For multiple changes: Use `/memory` to open editor
3. For initial setup: Use `/init` to create template

**Import best practices:**

```markdown
# Good: Reference existing docs
@README.md
@docs/architecture.md
@package.json

# Avoid: Copying content that exists elsewhere
# Instead of copying README content into CLAUDE.md, just import it
```

## Installation Instructions

### Setup Project Memory

#### Method 1: Using `/init` Command (Recommended)

The fastest way to set up project memory:

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Run the init command in Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   /init
   ```

3. **Claude will create and populate CLAUDE.md** with a template structure

4. **Customize the generated file** to match your project needs

5. **Commit to git:**
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md
   git commit -m "Initialize project memory with /init"
   ```

#### Method 2: Manual Creation

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create a CLAUDE.md in your project root:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   touch CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Add project standards:**
   ```bash
   cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
   # Project Configuration

   ## Project Overview
   - **Name**: Your Project Name
   - **Tech Stack**: List your technologies
   - **Team Size**: Number of developers

   ## Development Standards
   - Your coding standards
   - Naming conventions
   - Testing requirements
   EOF
   ```

3. **Commit to git:**
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md
   git commit -m "Add project memory configuration"
   ```

### Setup Personal Memory

1. **Create ~/.claude directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude
   ```

2. **Create personal CLAUDE.md:**
   ```bash
   touch ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **Add your preferences:**
   ```bash
   cat > ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
   # My Development Preferences

   ## About Me
   - Experience Level: [Your level]
   - Preferred Languages: [Your languages]
   - Communication Style: [Your style]

   ## Code Preferences
   - [Your preferences]
   EOF
   ```

### Setup Directory-Specific Memory

1. **Create memory for specific directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/directory/.claude
   touch /path/to/directory/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Add directory-specific rules:**
   ```bash
   cat > /path/to/directory/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
   # [Directory Name] Standards

   This file supplements root CLAUDE.md for this directory. Memory files are
   concatenated, not overridden — Claude Code loads this file on demand when it
   reads files in this directory.

   ## [Specific Standards]
   EOF
   ```

3. **Commit to version control:**
   ```bash
   git add /path/to/directory/CLAUDE.md
   git commit -m "Add [directory] memory configuration"
   ```

### Verify Setup

1. **Check memory locations:**
   ```bash
   # Project root memory
   ls -la ./CLAUDE.md

   # Personal memory
   ls -la ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Claude Code will automatically load** these files when starting a session

3. **Test with Claude Code** by starting a new session in your project

## Official Documentation

For the most up-to-date information, refer to the official Claude Code documentation:

- **[Memory Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)** - Complete memory system reference
- **[Slash Commands Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode)** - All built-in commands including `/init` and `/memory`
- **[CLI Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference)** - Command-line interface documentation

### Key Technical Details from Official Docs

**Memory Loading:**

- All memory files are automatically loaded when Claude Code launches
- Claude traverses upward from the current working directory to discover CLAUDE.md files
- Subtree files are discovered and loaded contextually when accessing those directories

**Import Syntax:**

- Use `@path/to/file` to include external content (e.g., `@~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md`)
- Supports both relative and absolute paths (relative paths resolve relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory)
- Recursive imports supported with a maximum depth of 4 hops
- First-time external imports trigger an approval dialog
- Not evaluated inside markdown code spans or code blocks
- Automatically includes referenced content in Claude's context

**CLAUDE.md Load Order** (concatenated into context, not strict override — see [Memory Hierarchy in Claude Code](#memory-hierarchy-in-claude-code) above):

1. Managed Policy (loads first)
2. User-Level Rules (`~/.claude/rules/`)
3. User Memory
4. Project Rules (`.claude/rules/`)
5. Project Memory
6. Local Project Memory (loads last)

Auto Memory is a separate mechanism (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`), not part of this concatenation order.
